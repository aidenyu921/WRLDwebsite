            <p>Juice WRLD (born December 2, 1998, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died December 8, 2019, Oak Lawn, Illinois) was an American rapper known for his freestyling ability and introspective lyrics. He first gained popularity on the music streaming platform SoundCloud but rapidly entered the pop mainstream to great success, garnering billions of streams in a career of only two years.</p>
            <p>Juice WRLD showed an early talent for music, learning instruments like piano, percussion, and guitar by a young age. After his parents' divorce, his mother encouraged his musical interests, leading him to upload songs to SoundCloud under the name "JuicetheKidd" in high school. He later changed it to Juice WRLD, saying the name was a creative choice. His rapid rise to fame and unique style left a lasting impact on the music industry.</p>

            <p>In 2017, Juice WRLD released his first EP, *Juice WRLD 9 9 9*, on SoundCloud, catching the attention of the Chicago music scene. He collaborated with producers DT and Nick Mira, whom he met on Twitter. The success of his single *All Girls Are the Same*, paired with a viral music video created with Cole Bennett of Lyrical Lemonade, propelled him to fame. By June 2018, his song *Lucid Dreams* reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100, marking his breakout into mainstream success.</p>
            <p>"Lucid Dreams," built on a sample of Sting’s "Shape of My Heart," became a defining song in the SoundCloud and emo rap movements. Its lyrics express heartbreak through a mix of rage and sorrow, while Juice WRLD's delivery combines melodic singing and rapping. The track's catchy hook and memorable instrumental led to over two billion streams on Spotify. Juice WRLD later revealed that he recorded the song in just about 20 minutes.</p>
            <p>Amid the success of "Lucid Dreams," Juice WRLD signed a $3 million deal with Interscope Records and released his debut studio album, Goodbye & Good Riddance, in May 2018, which peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. The album remained in the top 100 for over five years. In October 2018, Juice showcased his freestyling skills on Tim Westwood’s radio show and released a collaborative album with Future, WRLD ON DRUGS, which debuted at number one on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Juice WRLD blended Chicago drill, emo pop-punk, and SoundCloud rap, addressing themes of heartbreak, drug use, and mental illness. He aimed to normalize discussions on anxiety and depression. After the deaths of Lil Peep and XXXTentacion, he released *Too Soon..* (2018), with "Legends" honoring them.</p>

            <h2 style="color: brown;">Death and aftermath</h2>
            <p>In Australia, Juice WRLD's friends expressed concern about his drug use, which had started in high school and worsened with fame. He was misusing Xanax, Percocet, and "lean" to manage his mental health. After their intervention, he agreed to seek help and booked a rehab stay for December 2019.</p>
            <p>Before going to rehab, Juice WRLD celebrated his 21st birthday in Chicago, where his private jet was met by law enforcement after a tip-off about drugs and guns. While officers searched the plane and questioned his entourage, Juice WRLD suffered a seizure and died on the way to the hospital on December 8, 2019, six days after turning 21. The cause of death was an accidental overdose of codeine and oxycodone.</p>
